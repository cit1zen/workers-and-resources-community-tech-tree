# Community tech tree for Workers & Resources

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

A community tech tree replaces the Workers & Resources vanilla tech tree
with one that is bigger, better, and managed by the modders community.
The tree allows modders and content creators to lock their buildings
behind research in a scalable and synchronized way.

The tree also adds more realistic and challenging research gameplay for
players. The tech tree adds new research to all three kinds of universities
(technical, medical, political). That increases their importance and adds a
need to build all types of universities.
